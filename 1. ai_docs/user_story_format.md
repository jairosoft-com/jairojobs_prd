# User Story Format

## Overview

A user story is typically formatted as "As a [user type], I want [some goal] so
that [benefit/reason]". This format helps teams understand the user's
perspective and the value they'll receive from a feature.

### Here's a breakdown of the components

* "As a [user type]": This identifies the specific user or role who will be
  using the feature.
* "I want [some goal]": This describes what the user is trying to achieve
  with the feature.
* "so that [benefit/reason]": This explains the value or reason why the user
  wants to achieve that goal.

### Example

"As a registered user, I want to be able to log in using my email and password
so that I can access my account and profile."

## Conclusion

This format is widely used in agile development to help teams prioritize and
develop features that are valuable to users.
